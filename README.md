# Password Generator

## Description

This password generator allows for any user to create a randomized, strong password with the desired parameters included.

I created this password generator so that I can create secure credentials and protect myself from any bad-actors who might try to access my data.
Along the way, I learned how to create an interactive application with a real world use!
The code required me to become comfortable with functions, conditional statements, and logical operators. As well as implementing user alerts and inputs from the browser.
